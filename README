Introduction to gPHPedit
========================
The gPHPedit package contains a lightweight UTF-8 text editor based in 
scintilla component for the GNOME desktop.
gPHPEdit support PHP/HTML/CSS files and also support C/C++, Python and 
Perl Files.
gPHPedit is currently maintained by Anoop John.

Installation of gPHPEdit: (UBUNTU AND DEBIAN USERS)
===================================================
0) To install gPHPEdit from source:

    You can download source packages from: http://www.gphpedit.org

	TODO: installing from git?

1) Install gPHPEdit by running the following commands:

	$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$(pkg-config --variable=prefix ORBit-2.0) && make
	
	Now, as the root user:

	# make install

	1.b) Command Explanations:

	--prefix=$(pkg-config --variable=prefix ORBit-2.0): Setting the prefix 
	using this parameter instead of with $GNOME_PREFIX will ensure that the
	prefix is consistent with the installation environment and the package 
	will be installed in the correct location.

2) Dependencies

Compilation needs the following software packages - usually the headers 
and libraries (search for packages with a -dev or -devel suffix and/or 
prefix lib, e.g. libgtk2.0-dev)

		 - Glib 2.0 (>= 2.18)
	     - Gtk 2.0 (>= 2.18)

Translations
============
Transifex is a highly scalable localization platform with a focus on 
integrating well with the existing workflow of both translators and developers.
It aims in making it dead-simple for content providers to receive quality
translations from big translation communities, no matter where the project 
is hosted.

In order to translate gphpedit on transifex or upload translations here you 
need to:

   1. create a (free) account in the Transifex server;
   2. associate yourself with the gphpedit project and the specific language 
you want to work on;
   3. use the web interface to reserve a file for translation. 
This file can then be downloaded and translated offline and then submitted back
via the same interface. The translation is then validated and committed 
upstream into the official repository. 

If you are responsible for managing one of the language teams or just want to 
make sure you know what is happening with the project as a whole, 
you can choose to be notified every time someone reserves a file for 
translation, writes down a comment, reviews someoneâ€™s work, 
or a commit takes place. Since people will have to reserve a file for 
translation, you can make sure that no two people work on the same file at 
the same time, in the end saving time, headaches and redundancy. 
Best of all, since your work can be committed automatically when you upload 
your translation, you can see in real time your progress and 
that of your teammates.

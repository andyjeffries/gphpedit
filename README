	TODO: installing from git?

	1) Install gPHPEdit by running the following commands:

 	   $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$(pkg-config --variable=prefix ORBit-2.0) && make
	
	   Now, as the root user:

	   # make install

    1.b) Command Explanations:

		--prefix=$(pkg-config --variable=prefix ORBit-2.0): Setting the prefix using this parameter instead of with $GNOME_PREFIX 
		will ensure that the prefix is consistent with the installation environment and the package will be installed in the correct location.
